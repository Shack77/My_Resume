        <h3>CV-Based Attendance System Using Face Recognition</h3>
        <p>Built a real-time attendance system that automatically logs student presence using face recognition.
        Collected and preprocessed diverse student images. Leveraged OpenCV and dlib for accurate detection and recognition,
        logging attendance data with timestamps in SQLite. Enabled multi-face detection to track multiple students in live streams.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> OpenCV, dlib, Python, SQLite, Machine Learning</p>
